# 🎓6th Semester - Course Projects  

This repository contains coursework from the 6th semester, covering three main subjects:  

- **Databases** – Cooking Competition database design and implementation.  
- **Introduction to Operating Systems** – Process management and interprocess communication (IPC) in Linux.  
- **Programming Languages 1** – Exercises in multiple programming paradigms using C, Java, Python, SML/NJ, and Prolog.

## 🍽Cooking Competition Database (Databases)  
A relational database designed to manage all aspects of a cooking competition.  

- Includes tables for episodes, participants, judges, recipes, and scores.  
- Queries for rankings, episode results, and ingredient usage etc. 
- Used **MariaDB ** as Dadabase management system
- **Fully documented** with an ER diagram and implementation details.

## 🖥 Intro to Operating Systems  
Hands-on exercises exploring Linux process creation and communication.  

- **Process management** using `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`.  
- **IPC** mechanisms: pipes, sockets, message queues, and shared memory.  
- **Signal** handling for process control and synchronization.  
- And more.

## 💻Programming Languages 1  
Exercises demonstrating different programming paradigms.  

- **Imperative & Object-Oriented (C, Java)** – Data structures, OOP principles.  
- **Functional (SML/NJ)** – Recursion, pattern matching, higher-order functions.  
- **Logic (Prolog)** – Rule-based problem-solving and backtracking.  
- **Dynamic (Python)** – Scripting, list comprehensions, functional constructs.  
- Comparison of approaches to problem-solving across paradigms.  

## How to Use This Repository  
Each folder contains the relevant source code and a **PDF with exercise descriptions**.
