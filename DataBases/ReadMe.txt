                                              COOKING COMPETITION DATABASE

This repository contains the full code and documentation for a database project developed as part of a team assignment.

--------------------------------------------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------

The objective was to design and implement a hypothetical database to store all the necessary information for managing
a cooking competition. This includes:
- Episodes
- Participants
- Cooks
- Recipes
- Judges
- Scores and rankings
- Competition rounds and eliminations
- and more

To understand the project structure and functionality, it is recommended to start by reading the report. The database
file (.sql) contains pre-populated data, which may seem complex at first glance without prior context.

WHAT S IN THE REPORT?

- PROJECT BACKGROUND: The purpose of the database and its intended use.
- DATABASE DESIGN: Entity-relationship (ER) diagrams, table structures, and relationships.
- IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS: How the tables, constraints, and relationships were created.
- DATA POPULATION: Explanation of sample data included in the .sql file.
- QUERIES & USE CASES: Example SQL queries to retrieve key information (e.g., top-ranked participants, episode results, most-used ingredients).
- CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS: Problems encountered during development and how they were solved.
